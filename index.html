            <h2 clas="header-level-2">Introduction</h2>

    <p>The spinal cord is a cable about 43cm in length running from the brain stem to the lower back. 
    It contains two types of tissue. The inner core is gray matter made up of nerve cell bodies,
    unmyelinated axons, glial cells and blood vessels; the outer white matter is mainly composed of 
    tracts of myelinated axons thath relay impulses to and from the spinal cord and the brain.
    </br>

    </p>

    <h3 clas="header-level-3">Extent of spinal cord</h3>
    <p>
    During the body's growth and development, the spinal cord does not continue to lengthen the way that the spinal bones do:
    it therefore occupies only the first two-thirds of vertebral column. Cylindrical and slightly flattened, the spinal cord is about as 
    thick as a finger for most of its length; extending from the lower part if the spinal cord is a cluster of individual nerve fiver 
    called cauda equina.</br>

    </p>
    <h3 clas="header-level-3">Spinal nerves</h3>
    <p>
    Through 31 pairs of spinal nerves, the spinal cord is connected to the rest of the body; via these nerves, the spinal cord sends and receives
    information to and from the brain. The spinal nerves run through gaps between adjacent vertebrae and enter the back 
    and front of the spinal cord as spinal nerve root. </br>

     <h2 clas="header-level-2">The project</h2>

    <p>First of all, i made some sketches of the spinal cord to better understand his structure and to obtain the points for the curve.</br>
    <img src="https://github.com/giuliab/final-project/blob/master/material/base_sketch.jpg?raw=true"/>

    </p>
     <h3 clas="header-level-3">The Meninges</h3>
     <p>These are the <b>three protective layer</b> of connective tissue for the spinal cord.</p>
     <ul>
        <li><b>The Dura Mater:</b> is the outermost layer, and it forms a tough protective coating.</li>
        <li><b>The Arachnoid:</b> is the middle protective layer. Its name comes from the fact that the tissue has a spiderweb-like appearance.</li>
        <li><b>The Pia Mater:</b> is the innermost protective layer. It is very delicate and it is tightly associated with the surface of the spinal cord.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>To realize them, i started with the base of Dura mater by drawning a <code>BEZIER</code> curves and obtaining the surface (shown in the picture below) with the point interpolation (always using <code>BEZIER</code>, but with selector S1). </p>
     <img src="https://github.com/giuliab/final-project/blob/master/material/Snapshot1.png?raw=true"/>
    <p>The counturing surface've been realized through <code>createCylSurface</code>, in which i've used the PLASM function <code>CYLINDRICAL_SURFACE</code>.</p>
     <img src="https://github.com/giuliab/final-project/blob/master/material/Snapshot2.png?raw=true"/>
     <p>With the affine trasformation <code>T</code> and <code>S</code> applied  to the contour and the base, I realizad the other meninges and close them, as you can see in the following picture.</p>
     <img src="https://github.com/giuliab/final-project/blob/master/material/Snapshot3.png?raw=true"/>
     <img src="https://github.com/giuliab/final-project/blob/master/material/Snapshot4.png?raw=true"/>

     <h3 clas="header-level-3">The Fiber Tracts of the spinal cord</h3>
    <p>Myelinated nerve fibers in the spinal cord are grouped together according to the direction and the type of impulses between just a few pairs of spinal nerves.</p>
    <img src="https://github.com/giuliab/final-project/blob/master/material/spinal4.jpeg?raw=true"/>
    <p>The gray matter of spinal cord is organizad into areas called <b>horns</b>, which are:
    <ul>
      <li>Dorsal (back) horns: neuron cell bodies here receive information from sensory nerve fibers all around the body about sensation, including touch, temperature, awareness of muscle activity, and balance.</li>
     <li>Lateral (side) horns: existing only at certain levels of the spinal cord; neuron bodies in the lateral horns regulate the internal organs.</li> 
     <li>Ventral (front) horns: these contain neuron bodies that send fibers to the skeletal muscles, cousing contraction and movement.</li>
    </ul>
    To realize them, i used <code>BEZIER</code> curve and realize the surface through the points interpolation (alway using <code>Bezier</code> but with selector S1).
    </p>
    <img src="https://github.com/giuliab/final-project/blob/master/material/Snapshot8.png?raw=true"/>
    <p>The nerve in the fiber tracts have been realized with <code>BEZIER</code> and the traslation, through the affine trasformation <code>T</code>, of the nerve choosen as a sample.</p>
