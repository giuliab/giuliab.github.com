<p>The spinal cord is a cable about 43cm in length running from the brain stem to the lower back. 
It contains two types of tissue. The inner core is gray matter made up of nerve cell bodies,
unmyelinated axons, glial cells and blood vessels; the outer white matter is mainly composed of 
tracts of myelinated axons thath relay impulses to and from the spinal cord and the brain.

<h3 clas="header-level-3">Extent of spinal cord</h3>
<p>
During the body's growth and development, the spinal cord does not continue to lengthen the way that the spinal bones do: it 
therefore occupies only the first two-thirds of vertebral column. Cylindrical and slightly flattened, the spinal cord is about as 
thick as a finger for most of its length; extending from the lower part if the spinal cord is a cluster of individual nerve fiver 
called cauda equina.</br>

</p>
<h3 clas="header-level-3">Spinal nerves</h3>
<p>
Through 31 pairs of spinal nerves, the spinal cord is connected to the rest of the body; via these nerves, the spinal cord sends and receives
information to and from the brain. The spinal nerves run through gaps between adjacent vertebrae and enter the back 
and front of the spinal cord as spinal nerve root. </br>

 <h2 clas="header-level-2">The project</h2>

<p>First of all, i made some sketches of the spinal cord to better understand his structure and to obtain the points for the curve.</br>

 <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
